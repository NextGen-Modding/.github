# NextGen Modding
NextGen Modding serves as a collection of open-source modding tools that you may integrate into your games! Our tools enhance the modding experience for both singleplayer and multiplayer games.

We are in development and accepting any contributions from the open source community! Our goal is to make a version of each tool for the most popular game engines such as [Unity](https://unity.com/), [Unreal Engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5), and [Godot Engine](http://godotengine.org/)!

## Tools
### [Foundry](https://github.com/NextGen-Modding/foundry)
Foundry is our workshop tool. This allows clients to download and play mods from a configured external source such as a website or application. With that said, server owners may also use this tool to upload or download custom content such as mods onto their server(s).

Before connecting, the client will securely download all custom content required by the server (e.g. mods). The game will mount the content right before loading the client into the server. Additionally, support for downloading and mounting custom content while in-game will also be supported.
