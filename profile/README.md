# NextGen Modding
NextGen Modding serves as a collection of open source game and modding tools. Our game development tools will be built for [Godot](http://godotengine.org/), an open source game engine. Our goal is to allow game developers to easily integrate these tools into their game(s).

We are still under heavy development!

## Tools
### [Server Dot](https://github.com/nextgen-modding/server-dot)
A future all-in-one dedicated server tool for [Godot](http://godotengine.org/).

### [Foundry](https://github.com/NextGen-Modding/foundry)
A future powerful workshop library and tool that allows players and server owners to download or upload content for their games.

### [Pivot](https://github.com/NextGen-Modding/pivot)
A future mod launcher tool which will allow users to automatically download and install mods for a variety of games.

**Note** - These tools are completely open source and their names are subject to change for now.
