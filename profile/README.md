# NextGen Modding
NextGen Modding serves as a collection of open-source modding tools that you may integrate into your games! Our tools enhance the modding experience for both singleplayer and multiplayer games.

We are in development and accepting any contributions from the open source community! Our goal is to make a version of each tool for the most popular game engines such as [Unity](https://unity.com/), [Unreal Engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5), and [Godot Engine](http://godotengine.org/)!

## Tools
### [Foundry](https://github.com/NextGen-Modding/foundry)
A powerful and all-in-one workshop library and tool that takes your game's community-made content to the next level! This tool will integrate everything you need to support singleplayer and multiplayer modding.

### [CrateIt](https://github.com/NextGen-Modding/createit)
A tool that allows you to create specific custom content such as maps, 3D models, and textures quicker and easier than a game engine. It simplifies the process.

### [Pivot](https://github.com/NextGen-Modding/pivot)
A hub that may be utilized by any game developer or community! This tool will interface our [Foundry](https://github.com/NextGen-Modding/foundry) and [CreateIt](https://github.com/NextGen-Modding/createit) tools and libraries along with allow you to install mods and custom content similar to mod launchers!

**Note** - These tools are completely open source and their names are subject to change for now.
